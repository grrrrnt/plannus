# *PlanNUS*


## What is PlanNUS?
*PlanNUS* is a web application catered towards students of the National University of Singapore (NUS). As the name suggests, it is a tool for students to plan their academic timetables by automatically generating the most ideal timetables for them. *PlanNUS* is designed to be a companion tool for NUSMods and aims to aims to ease the burden of NUS students in the process of timetable planning, which can get quite overwhelming at times.

## How does it work?
All that a student needs to do is select a semester, the modules they intend to take for that semester, and their priorities ranked from most to least important. *PlanNUS* will process all of this information using its algorithm and output a list of personally tailored timetables. Students can then save the timetables they like, and even share these timetables with friends should they wish to coordinate their classes together.
